# CyVerse Focus Forum webinar:

Docker is container technology that wraps software of interest (e.g., a bioinformatics tool) together with all its software dependencies so it can run in a reproducible manner regardless of the environment. This CyVerse Focus Forum webinar will provide an introduction to Docker as well as hands-on introduction to Docker for bringing tools into the Discovery Environment.

### Self-guided exercise 

Install Docker
==============

For Linux users, you need to install [Docker engine] (https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). For PC and Mac users you need to install [Docker toolbox for Mac and Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) and use [Docker Machine] (https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started/) to create a virtual machine to run your Docker containers. Once your machine is created and you have connected your shell to this new machine, you're ready to run Docker commands on this host.  

Now, configure the default user to use Docker:

`sudo usermod -aG docker <user>`

and log out and log back in.

Run Docker
==========

Once you are done installing Docker, test your Docker installation by running the following:

```
$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
03f4658f8b78: Pull complete
a3ed95caeb02: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:8be990ef2aeb16dbcb9271ddfe2610fa6658d13f6dfb8bc72074cc1ca36966a7
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
```
If you see the above output then your Docker installation is successful. You can procede to Building images with Docker now

Building images
===============

For the self-guided tutorial, let's build a Docker image for the MEGAHIT short-read assembler. This is all based on the `Assembling E. coli tutorial
<http://angus.readthedocs.org/en/2015/assembling-ecoli.html>`--.

You can use a Dockerfile to build an image. Let's encode the commands needed to build a `megahit` image in a Dockerfile::

```
mkdir ~/make_megahit
cd ~/make_megahit
cat <<EOF > Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:14.04
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y g++ make git zlib1g-dev python
RUN git clone https://github.com/voutcn/megahit.git /home/megahit \
    && cd /home/megahit \
    && git checkout 01b6692a4286973343da133f63d9e3c1252a5e8e \
    && make
ENTRYPOINT ["/home/megahit/megahit"]
EOF
```

Let's look at this Dockerfile before running it::

`cat Dockerfile`

Now see what each command in Docker file does::

The `FROM` command tells Docker what base image to load; the `RUN`
commands tell Docker what to execute (and then save the results from);
and the `ENTRYPOINT` specifies the script entry point - a command that is
run if no other command is given.

Let's build a Docker image from this and see what happens! ::

docker build -t megahit .

(This will take a few minutes..)

This creates a new image named `megahit`. If you run:

`docker images`

you should see something like:

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
megahit             latest              749fd74397ed        29 seconds ago      427.5 MB
ubuntu              14.04               91e54dfb1179        3 days ago          188.4 MB

```

Once it's built, you can now test the built `megahit` image by running it like so ::

`docker run megahit`

You should see all the command line arguments for `megahit` image

But this is not useful. You should test the same image using input arguments like so ::

First download the test data into a scratch directory ::

```
mkdir ~/my-scratch-dir
cd ~/my-scratch-dir
wget http://public.ged.msu.edu.s3.amazonaws.com/ecoli_ref-5m-trim.se.fq.gz
wget http://public.ged.msu.edu.s3.amazonaws.com/ecoli_ref-5m-trim.pe.fq.gz

```

Now run it like so ::

```
docker run -v ~/my-scratch-dir:/working-dir -w /working-dir \
            megahit --12 ecoli_ref-5m-trim.pe.fq.gz \
            -r ecoli_ref-5m-trim.se.fq.gz -o ecoli -t 4

```
If the tool's container produced outputs in that host's scratch directory (`ecoli` in this case), then your tool is ready for the further steps.

Now You can tag the image like so ::

`docker tag ubuntu/megahit:<tag> <user>/megahit:<tag>`

If you wanted to make this broadly available, the next steps
would be to log into the [Docker Hub] (https://hub.docker.com/) and push it; I did so with
these commands: ``docker login`` and ``docker push <user>/megahit:<tag>``.

Summary points
==============

* Docker provides a nice way to bundle multiple packages of software
  together, for both yourself and for others to run.

* Docker gives you a good way to isolate what you're running from the
  data you're running it on.

* The Dockerfile enhances reproducibility by giving explicit instructions
  for what to install, rather than simply bundling it all in a binary.
