# CyVerse Focus Forum webinar:

Docker is container technology that wraps software of interest (e.g., a bioinformatics tool) together with all its software dependencies so it can run in a reproducible manner regardless of the environment. This CyVerse Focus Forum webinar will provide an introduction to Docker before delving into how to use it to bring tools into the Discovery Environment.

### Pre-webinar preparation

### Install Docker

1. For Linux users, you need to install [Docker engine] (https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). For PC and Mac users you need to install [Docker toolbox for Mac and Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) and use [Docker Machine] (https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started/) to create a virtual machine to run your Docker containers. Once your machine is created and you have connected your shell to this new machine, you're ready to run Docker commands on this host.
